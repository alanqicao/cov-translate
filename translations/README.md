Import/Export all translation JSON files to/from POEditor in this directory.

Steps:
- Manually save the English reference strings file in this directory.
- Import the reference file in POEditor from GitHub
- Complete translations in each language in POEditor
- Export each completed language file from POEditor to this directory in JSON format. If POEditor does not create new files on GitHub, first create a blank placeholder file here (one for each language/locale) that POEditor can export to.
